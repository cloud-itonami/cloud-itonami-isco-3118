(ns technical-drafting.store
  "SSoT for the ISCO-08 3118 technical draughtsperson actor. Store is a
  protocol injected into the `technical-drafting.actor` StateGraph — `MemStore`
  is the default, deterministic, zero-dep backend; a Datomic/kotoba-server-backed
  implementation can be swapped in without touching the actor or governor
  (itonami actor pattern, per ADR-2607011000 / CLAUDE.md Actors section).

  Domain:

    project  — a registered design project (:project-id, :designer-id, :name)
    record   — a committed technical drafting record under a project
               (drawing draft, drawing revision, specification note,
               design discrepancy flag, designer review proposal) — written ONLY via
               commit-record!, never mutated in place
    ledger   — an append-only audit trail of every proposal/verdict/
               disposition, regardless of outcome (commit or hold)")
